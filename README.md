# cppfetch

I decided to learn CPP, and I'm using this project as way to actively learn it.

I decided an information gathering program because I'm already accustomed to making<br>
such programs in other languages.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phate6660/cppfetch
cd cppfetch
mkdir build && cd $_
meson ..
ninja # Or whatever generator you have set for `meson`
      # `make` is the default but I personally really like `ninja`
```
